This project was started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version of thier guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).


[Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs) for styling the React components with CSS. Their documentation for use and tooling is excellent!


## Setting up
If you would like to checkout this repo. You will need <code>[node](https://nodejs.org/en/)</code>  installed. You can use <code>[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)</code> instead of <code>npm</code>. Now start the process with the following:
```
> git clone https://github.com/linoxyn/worktimer.git
> cd worktimer
> npm install
> npm start
```

### Alternatively
Download the .zip file. Extract the contents, go to the project directory, start your terminal:
```
> npm install
> npm start
```

### Eslint and Prettier
You will need to set some rules up in your editor and also in your <code>.eslintrc</code> file to take advantage of automatically linting files on save. 

A great guide to set this up in the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor can be found on [Nicky's Blog](http://nickymeuleman.netlify.com/blog/automagically-lint/).
